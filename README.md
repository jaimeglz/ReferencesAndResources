======================

Contains maps with hyperlinks to Internet resources and local files, as well as short documentation on diverse mathematics-related topics. The [web page ] (http://jaimeglz.github.io/) that has been generated from these maps is focused mainly on Python, R, and Maxima resources and tools for engineering and scientific computation.

The maps in this project are intended to be displayed in a desktop or portable computer as [mind maps] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map), either as stand-alone or interconnected documents. The advantage of mind maps is that they can be easily updated, and can be used to generate web-pages. They can also be transformed to other formats, such as Open and MS Office documents and PDF files.  

The objective of this initiative is to provide a user-friendly means for documenting, publishing and accessing information and materials on the subjects being covered. GitHub users can fork this repository to adapt the maps or their structure to their own needs.

The maps are still at an experimental prototype stage, and are initially being developed with XMind. A free version of this software can be downloaded from [XMind.net] (http://www.xmind.net/). Hopefully, they will become self-explanatory and easy to use.
 
On the author: I have participated in the development and programming of a wide array of IT solutions, as can be glimpsed in my [linkedin profile] (https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jaime-gonzalez/33/6b0/213). As for math, I am an enthusiast of the subjects covered in the maps, and not an expert.
