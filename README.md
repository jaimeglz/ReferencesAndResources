ReferencesAndResources
======================

Contains maps with hyperlinks to Internet resources and local files, as well as short documentation on diverse knowledge topics. These maps are intenteded to be visible in the desktop as [mind maps] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map), and to be published as web-pages that have been generated with mind mapping software.

The objective of this initiative is to provide a means that will permit users to access publicly avaible information and materials on the subjects being covered. GitHub users can also fork this repository to adapt the maps and their structure to their own needs.

The maps are still at an experimental stage, and are initally being developed with XMind. A free version of this software can be downloaded from [XMind.net] (http://www.xmind.net/). Hopefully, they will become self-explanatory and easy to use.

The first subject being developed is Mathematics, and the directory structure corresponds to [MSC2010] (http://msc2010.org/Default.html).
